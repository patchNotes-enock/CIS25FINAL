# CIS 25 FINAL PROJECT

I made a turn-based RPG battle that allows the user to choose from one of three characters to fight a dragon.
Each character has unique values for their attack stats (strength, magic, and critical attack), and you can 
choose which type of attack to use as you alternate attacks with the dragon. Each turn presents the user with 
a menu that allows them to choose from 1) Attack, 2) Magic, 3) Critical (Attack), and 4) Items. 

There are four items at your disposal (two that heal the player and two that deal damage to the opponent),
and the program also keeps track of how many of each item are used/remaining in the player's inventory.
